        <div class="project-description">
            <p class="indented-paragraph">Series of hollow porcelain sculptures cast from anonymous rags gathered
                at the Rovdino village cemetery, where the artist's destant relatives are
                buried. The process of casting and firing the porcelain burns up the original
                fabric, leaving its hollow porcelain shell. "Rags" is part of Ekateria's diploma
                project for her BFA at Parsons titled "Cloudberry Season". Over the course
                of two weeklong trips to Rovdino Village, her great-grandfather's home in
                Archangelsk Region in the Russia.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph italic-padded-paragraph">"In 2016 I first sparked an interest in visiting the birthplace of my great-grandfather.
                It came instinctively, withdrawn from any anthropological goals of research, or
                interest in the distinct fates and identities of its current inhabitants. Rather, it
                surged from an interest linked to the physical earth located at a specific set of
                geographic coordinates; the aura of a place that has almost completely been
                erased by time, yet holds the last clues and fragments to my origins.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph italic-padded-paragraph">My first visit to the remote village of Kopeetskaya near Rovdino in the northern
                Archangelsk region of Russia unfolded like a dream sequence in one of Tarkovsky’s
                films. A fourteen hour train ride, followed by two hours by car and a river crossing
                brought me, like into the stalker’s zone, to the source of my family’s history. Stepping
                ashore, the only evident connections I drew were to the physical elements present
                there, on that land: the house, the earth, the trees. Each story that led up to that
                first encounter with the physical experience of this location’s presence had been
                self-contradictory. Each account of events told to me by my family and by the
                locals there, winds in on itself, tripping over exaggerated truths passed down as
                though through a game of broken telephone over four generations. It fuses with
                superstitions, wives tales and the looming ghostly presence of a soviet history,
                shaping the filtered impression I came to experience from my time stepping on
                that soil.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph italic-padded-paragraph">The result, formulated in words and images is murky: an arrangement of testimonies,
                photographic fragments, video and sound recordings and surreal memories. Yet
                they all culminate in their connection to the geographic location of Kopeetskaya
                village. The only experience I seemed to be sure of taking away with me was my
                memory of the spacial and temporal presence there, of experiencing the smells,
                sounds and tastes of the earth of my ancestor existing outside of time."</p>
