            <p class="indented-paragraph">"Nothing to Lose but the Sky" is a project complied by Ekaterina Costa in 2023,
                photographed in the artist's family apartment January and February 2022 in
                Moscow, Russia.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">At the eve of the New Year 2022 the Russian-American artist returned to her
                native Moscow after years living abroad in Paris, France to care for her mother
                during the last months of her life. Ravaged by cancer, her mother was bedridden
                with compromised immunity in the midst of the COVID-19 pandemic. Ekaterina
                and her grandmother provided palliative care and stayed by her mother's
                side almost without leaving the apartment. Venturing into the unknown, to
                confrontation with human mortality, the artist reflected on the life her mother
                led, contained entirely within the walls of the apartment. During those months
                of isolation, the artist's only contact with the outside world was through the
                apartment's large windows. She spent her time meticulously documenting the
                cracks of light into the world beyond the glass, and recording this domestic
                space that had become so familiar, oppressive and heavy. Delving into the
                secrets revealed in every seemingly familiar detail of the family home, that
                before seemed so familiar, so mundane.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">Following the death of her mother on February 16th, 2022 and the invasion
                of Ukraine by Russia six days later, Ekaterina had to leave Russia on February
                25th, not knowing when she would be able to return. The nine Kodak Tri-X
                films she brought back to Paris became her only testimony, her record of this
                period.</p>
            <p class="indented-paragraph">The suggested print technique for this series is Piezography Pro Charcoal
                prints on awagami unryu paper, of near transparent 33g thickness, floating
                weightlessly against the light to emulate the effect of window panes.
                Like floating curtains, the photographs compose a theatre emptied of its
                inhabitants, confronted with the passage of time, like palimpsests of memory.</p>
